# 🎬 arrstack-mcp

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives AI assistants configurable access to homelab media and game services.

Works with **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **VS Code Copilot**, **OpenClaw**, and any other MCP-compatible client.

Only configure the services you use — unconfigured services are gracefully skipped.

## Choose Your Services

To avoid flooding an MCP client's context with tools it does not need, the
advertised tool catalog is configurable:

- `ENABLED_SERVICES=auto` (default) advertises only services with a configured URL.
- A comma-separated list such as `sonarr,radarr,romm` advertises exactly that subset.
- `ENABLED_SERVICES=all` advertises every available tool.
- Run `python server.py --list-services` to inspect configured/enabled services.
- Run `python server.py --setup` for an interactive selector that prints the
  resulting `ENABLED_SERVICES` line.

Valid service names are `sonarr`, `radarr`, `lidarr`, `prowlarr`,
`qbittorrent`, `rdtclient`, `sabnzbd`, `jellyfin`, `romm`, `gamevault`, and
`bookshelf`. Aliases `qbt`, `rdt`, and `sab` are also accepted.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Claude Desktop / Cursor / VS Code (stdio)

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.9.0,<2" httpx
   ```

2. Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "arrstack": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/path/to/arrstack-mcp/server.py"],
         "env": {
           "SONARR_URL": "http://localhost:8989",
           "SONARR_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
           "RADARR_URL": "http://localhost:7878",
           "RADARR_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
           "QBT_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
           "QBT_USER": "admin",
           "QBT_PASS": "your-password",
           "JELLYFIN_URL": "http://localhost:8096"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart your MCP client. Done!

### Option 2: Docker (HTTP transport)

For remote setups or when running alongside your *arr stack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ct4nk3r/arrstack-mcp.git
cd arrstack-mcp
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your service URLs and API keys
docker compose up -d
```

The server runs on port `8000` with Streamable HTTP transport.

#### Connect to OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw mcp set arrstack '{"url":"http://arrstack-mcp:8000/mcp","transport":"streamable-http"}'
```

#### Connect to other HTTP MCP clients

Point your client to `http://<host>:8000/mcp` using Streamable HTTP transport.

### Option 3: Docker on the same network as your *arr stack

If your media services run in Docker, add `arrstack-mcp` to the same network:

```yaml
services:
  arrstack-mcp:
    build: .
    container_name: arrstack-mcp
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - SONARR_URL=http://sonarr:8989
      - SONARR_API_KEY=your-key
      - RADARR_URL=http://radarr:7878
      - RADARR_API_KEY=your-key
      - QBT_URL=http://qbittorrent:8080
      - QBT_USER=admin
      - QBT_PASS=your-password
      - JELLYFIN_URL=http://jellyfin:8096
    networks:
      - your-media-network
```

## Agentic Resource Discovery (ARD)

arrstack-mcp implements the **publisher** side of [Agentic Resource Discovery](https://agenticresourcediscovery.org/)
([spec](https://github.com/ards-project/ard-spec)) — an open standard for
publishing and discovering AI capabilities across the web. This lets ARD
registries and agents find your server and learn how to connect to it, instead
of every client needing a hand-written config.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ARD publishes **discoverable metadata only**. It does *not* add authentication
> to this server or make it safe to expose to the internet — the catalog just
> describes what tools exist. The MCP endpoint still controls your media stack
> with your credentials, so keep it behind Tailscale or an authenticated proxy
> (see [Security](#security)). Discovery is not a substitute for verifying who
> you connect to.

When running an HTTP transport, the server publishes two documents, generated
live from whatever `ENABLED_SERVICES` advertises:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` | The ARD **capability manifest**. Advertises this server as a single `application/mcp-server-card+json` entry with `capabilities` (the enabled tool names), `representativeQueries` for semantic search, and a domain-anchored `urn:air` identifier (plus an optional `did:web` identity, see below). |
| `/.well-known/mcp-server-card.json` | The **MCP server card** the catalog references: every advertised tool with its `inputSchema`, plus the MCP endpoint and transport. |

Both are served with `Content-Type: application/json`. When `ARD_PUBLIC_URL` is
set (i.e. you've opted into public discovery), they also send
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so browser-based crawlers can fetch them from
any origin; on a private deployment that wildcard CORS header is omitted.
Server-side crawlers ignore CORS and work either way.

### Identity & trust

The catalog entry's `identifier` is a **domain-anchored `urn:air` URN** — a
stable *logical* name (e.g. `urn:air:arrstack.example.com:server:arrstack`); it
does not need to resolve. A `did:web` host identity is **opt-in**: it's only
emitted when you set `ARD_DID_WEB` to a domain whose root you control and where
you host a [DID document](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) at
`/.well-known/did.json`. It is never inferred from `ARD_PUBLIC_URL`/`ARD_DOMAIN`,
so the catalog never advertises an identity that can't be verified. This
implementation does **not** include a cryptographic `trustManifest` (signing /
attestations) — that's an optional, enterprise-grade layer of the spec.

### Publishing

1. Set `ARD_PUBLIC_URL` to the URL clients reach this server at, e.g.
   `https://arrstack.example.com`. The catalog then advertises an absolute
   connection endpoint (override the URN namespace with `ARD_DOMAIN`).
2. Serve it over **HTTPS** on your public domain (a reverse proxy / Tailscale
   Funnel / Cloudflare Tunnel in front of port `8000`).
3. Check discovery works:

   ```bash
   curl https://arrstack.example.com/.well-known/ai-catalog.json
   ```

Startup logs print the discovery URL when ARD is enabled. Set `ARD_ENABLED=false`
to turn the endpoints off.

### Static hosting on GitHub Pages (no domain, no public server)

You don't need a custom domain **or** a publicly exposed MCP server to publish a
discoverable catalog — host it as a static file on GitHub Pages, anchored to the
`github.io` domain you already control. This repo ships a workflow
([`.github/workflows/ard-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/ard-pages.yml)) that
regenerates the catalog from `server.py` on every change and deploys it, so it
never goes stale.

**Setup (one-time, ~2 minutes):**

1. **Enable Pages:** repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:
   "GitHub Actions"**.
2. **Flip the deploy gate on:** repo **Settings → Secrets and variables →
   Actions → Variables**, add `ARD_PAGES_ENABLED` = `true`. (The deploy job is
   skipped until you do this, so the workflow stays green beforehand — GitHub's
   token can't enable Pages for you, so this is an explicit opt-in.)
3. **Run it:** push to `main` (or **Actions → Publish ARD catalog → Run
   workflow**). The catalog goes live at:

   ```
   https://ct4nk3r.github.io/arrstack-mcp/.well-known/ai-catalog.json
   ```

4. **Verify:**

   ```bash
   curl -L https://ct4nk3r.github.io/arrstack-mcp/.well-known/ai-catalog.json
   ```

Before you complete steps 1–2, the workflow still runs and stays green: the
**Build ARD catalog** job generates and validates the catalog, and the deploy
job is simply skipped.

With no configuration, the publisher identity defaults to your Pages domain —
`urn:air:ct4nk3r.github.io:server:arrstack`. This matches the ARD spec's "solo
developer" examples (which use identifiers like `urn:air:github.com:alice-dev:...`).
GitHub Pages serves the file over HTTPS with `Content-Type: application/json` and
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, satisfying the ARD hosting requirements, and
the manifest embeds the full server card inline so it's self-contained.

> [!NOTE]
> The default identity is the `urn:air` URN only — a stable logical name, not a
> resolvable address. A `did:web` identity is **not** advertised by default,
> because a project Pages site (`<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`) can't host the
> `did.json` at the `<owner>.github.io` root that `did:web` resolution expects.
> Only set `ARD_DID_WEB` if you serve a DID document at that domain's root (e.g.
> via a `<owner>.github.io` user site or a custom domain).

**Optional repo variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables) let you override the defaults:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ARD_DOMAIN` | `<owner>.github.io` | `urn:air` publisher namespace (a logical name). Set this if you later get a custom domain. |
| `ARD_PUBLIC_URL` | _(none)_ | Where your MCP server actually runs, advertised inside the card. Leave blank if it's private (e.g. Tailscale-only). |
| `ARD_HOST_NAME` | `arrstack-mcp` | Friendly catalog host name. |
| `ARD_DID_WEB` | _(none)_ | Opt-in `did:web` identity; only set for a domain whose root serves a `/.well-known/did.json`. |

### Getting it indexed by registries

Hosting makes the catalog _reachable_; registries still have to find it. Without
a custom domain you have two routes:

- **Direct fetch / manual submission (works now).** Any agent or registry you
  give the URL above can fetch and index it immediately — the spec explicitly
  supports bypassing search and fetching a known catalog directly. Many
  registries also let you submit a catalog URL for crawling.
- **Automatic `.well-known` discovery (optional, still no purchase).** Crawlers
  that probe `https://<domain>/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` expect it at a domain
  _root_. To get that for free, create a GitHub **user site** — a repo named
  `ct4nk3r.github.io` — and host the same files there, so the catalog sits at
  `https://ct4nk3r.github.io/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` (root, not a
  subpath). Copy [`.github/workflows/ard-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/ard-pages.yml)
  and [`server.py`](server.py)/[`ard.py`](ard.py) into that repo, or just commit
  the generated `ai-catalog.json` from the manual command below.

> [!TIP]
> If you _do_ get a domain later, you can either add a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
> to this Pages site (served at `https://<your-domain>/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`),
> or keep hosting on `github.io` and add a DNS record on your domain:
> `_catalog._agents.<your-domain>  TXT  "url=https://ct4nk3r.github.io/arrstack-mcp/.well-known/ai-catalog.json"`.

### Generating the files manually

To host elsewhere (another repo, S3, a CDN, your own server), generate the
documents yourself:

```bash
ARD_DOMAIN=ct4nk3r.github.io ARD_EMBED_CARD=true \
  python server.py --print-catalog > ai-catalog.json
ARD_DOMAIN=ct4nk3r.github.io \
  python server.py --print-server-card > mcp-server-card.json
```

`ARD_EMBED_CARD=true` makes `--print-catalog` embed the server card inline so the
manifest is self-contained (the default `auto` only embeds when `ARD_PUBLIC_URL`
is unset). See [`examples/`](examples/) for sample output.

## Finding Your API Keys

- **Sonarr**: Settings → General → API Key
- **Radarr**: Settings → General → API Key
- **Lidarr**: Settings → General → API Key
- **Prowlarr**: Settings → General → API Key
- **qBittorrent**: Settings → Web UI → Authentication
- **SABnzbd**: Config → General → API Key
- **RDTClient**: Settings → General → Authentication (or set
  `Authentication: None` to allow open access on a trusted network)
- **Jellyfin**: Dashboard → API Keys → Add
- **RomM**: User profile → API Tokens, or configure `ROMM_USER` and `ROMM_PASS`
- **GameVault**: Admin panel → API Keys
- **Bookshelf**: Settings → General → API Key (same as Readarr)

## Security

The HTTP/SSE transports listen on `0.0.0.0:8000` by default, and MCP does not
provide authentication by itself. Anyone who can reach that port can invoke
tools using the configured service credentials.

- Prefer stdio for same-machine clients.
- For remote access, restrict port `8000` to Tailscale or place it behind an
  authenticated reverse proxy.
- DNS-rebinding protection is enabled. Set `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to the exact
  hostnames or IP addresses clients use, with optional wildcard ports:
  `localhost:*,127.0.0.1:*,arrstack-mcp:*,100.64.0.1:*`.
- The Docker image runs as non-root user `appuser` with UID `1000`.
- API keys and request headers are never logged.
